# Full-Stack Employee Management System

## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive full-stack web application crafted with the **Java Spring** framework for the backend and **React.js** for the frontend. The system offers robust functionality, including **JWT-based user authentication and authorization** and complete **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It is powered by key Spring framework libraries such as **Spring Security**, **Spring Web**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **Spring JDBC** on the backend. The frontend is built with **React**, **ReactRouter**, and styled using the sleek **Chakra UI** framework. 

Additionally, the application integrates with a **PostgreSQL** database, and users can perform tasks like **registration**, **password reset**, and **password change**, offering a rich and intuitive user experience. This project is a perfect resource for both beginner and experienced developers looking to learn or contribute to full-stack development with modern tools.

Feel free to **clone**, **experiment**, and **contribute** to this open-source project!
